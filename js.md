**Is it fine to learn JavaScript as your first language for web development or is it better to start with HTML and CSS**   
Definitely learn HTML and CSS first. Many take HTML and mostly CSS understanding for granted. But believe me when I say that without a clear understanding of the DOM and CSS you will really struggle as a Web Developer. I have seen bugs get re-opened over and over and over again for the simplest of CSS mistakes. Not being able to cleanly and effectively assemble your layout structure with a stable set of styles can easily turn a 1-day task into a 2-week nightmare and have you wishing you never picked up this career. 

The big misnomer is that many individuals learn things just enough to be able to Google if they get stuck. CSS isn't one of those things. You can't Google your way out of a CSS bug. Without understanding it, believe me, you can't. The only way is to understand how the cascade works. Once you understand CSS fully then move on to JavaScript.
