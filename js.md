**Is it fine to learn JavaScript as your first language for web development or is it better to start with HTML and CSS**   
Learn HTML and CSS first. Many take HTML and CSS understanding for granted. But without a clear understanding of the DOM and CSS you will struggle as a Web Developer. Not being able to cleanly and effectively assemble your layout with a stable set of styles can easily turn a 1-day task into a 2-week nightmare.

The big misnomer is that many individuals learn things just enough to be able to Google if they get stuck. CSS isn't one of those things. You can't Google your way out of a CSS bug. The only way is to understand how the cascade works. Once you fully understand CSS then move on to JavaScript.
