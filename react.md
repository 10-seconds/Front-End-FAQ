# React

**What are the pre requesites(excluding the general HTML, CSS, and JS) before starting off with React?**

There are no other prerequisites apart from HTML, CSS, and JS (although a good level of comfort is needed with JS). All you need is a [script tag](https://reactjs.org/docs/add-react-to-a-website.html) that pulls in React and then you can write your own React code in a simple JS file.
You can start with the official docs' [getting started](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) page which are very beginner friendly.
