<summary>Which IDE or code editor should I use?</summary>

[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) is a great choice and provides a lot of web friendly features out of the box, along with many 3rd party extensions to customize it just the way you like.

Some other alternatives are [Atom](https://atom.io), [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com), [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/).
