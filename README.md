# Front-End-FAQ
A place to anonymously ask questions and receive answers from the dev community.

## How It Works
The premise is simple: Ask the questions you've always had about Front-End Development but were too afraid to ask for fear of criticism, then wait for a response!

## How Is This Different Than Stack Overflow?
It's true that Stack Overflow is meant for knowledge sharing. That being said, as a beginner I know I had a ton of questions about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that I wanted answered, but anonymously. Stack Overflow requires you to be logged in. Yes, you can change your name, but that's a hastle and has a 30-day waiting period to re-change. I want to remove the hastle of asking and answering questions.

Front-End FAQ will be the one place you can go to for all your Front-end questions, while remaining anonymous.  Plus, it's a great way to contribute to open-source.
